The ArcAero_Engine_Rescale.cfg patch does the following:

Rescales engine pod to smaller size.  Short size fits on Mk1 and Mk1-3 pod.  
Also allows room to fit chutes inline with engine pod between pod and nose
of Wyvern Capsule.

The ArcAero_Engine_LFO.cfg patch does the following:

Creates a LFO version of the engine pod.  Sized so that 4 pods are the
equivalent of a Terrier.  Each has the same atmosphere curve of a
Terrier at 1/4 the thrust.  No fuel is carried, so a fuel tank attached
to the command pod is needed (Pay attention to cross feed restrictions)

The LFO version changes the Fuel Type markings of the texture, to *orange*,
to denote LFO, vs *yellow* for RCS.
