## Requirements

    RasterPropMonitor is required for the IVA.
    RealPlume config is included.
    VenStockRevamp is strongly recommended but not required. These parts were designed to fit in with Ven's style.
    Works with Ferram Aerospace Research.
    Tested in both KSP 1.9.1 and 1.8.1
	(*Should* be backward compatable all the way back to 1.4.0)


## Credits

	@Ven for Ven's Stock Revamp, for the models and textures for the top and bottom of the capsule (and an incredible art style to boot);
	@MOARdV and @Mihara for RasterPropMonitor (for the IVA props); and
	@EmbersArc for Kerbal Reusability Expansion (which inspired the idea of a modern crew capsule mod for KSP)
 

## Installation

Just download the mod and unzip it into your GameData folder. Make sure you have RasterPropMonitor (adopted) installed, available seperately.

Note that the capsule's files are within the ArcAerospace folder.

Don't forget to credit Ven if you reuse the textures or models! The top and bottom of the Wyvern capsule are taken directly from Ven's Mk1-2 remodel.
