## Installation

Just download the mod file (.zip) and unzip it into your GameData folder. Note that the mod's files are within the ArcAerospace folder.

(However you manage it, just make sure the /ArcAerospace folder is directly a subfolder (like where the /Squad folder is), just inside your /GameData folder.

Make sure you have B9 PartSwitch and RasterPropMonitor (Adopted) installed, available seperately.

Tested in both KSP 1.9.1 and 1.8.1
  (*Should* be backward compatable all the way back to 1.4.0)

   
## Credits

 * @zlsa for giving me their blessing to pick this mod up.
 * @Ven for Ven's Stock Revamp, for the models and textures for the top and bottom of the capsule (and an incredible art style to boot);
 * @MOARdV, @Mihara, & @JohnnyOThan for RasterPropMonitor (for the IVA props); and
 * @EmbersArc for Kerbal Reusability Expansion (which inspired the idea of a modern crew capsule mod for KSP)
 * @Tonka Crash for major suggestions (long/short & Mono/LFO engine versions), balancing, and especially reminding me of some long forgotten, unfinished work I had done on the mod. This "continuation" wouldnt have happened with them.
 * And a HUGE shoutout to @JadeOfMaar for basically writing the B9 patch for me. ;)

Don't forget to credit [Ven](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/109931-ven/) if you reuse the textures or models! The top and bottom of the Wyvern capsule are taken directly from Ven's Mk1-2 remodel.
